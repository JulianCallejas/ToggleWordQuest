                <p>Additionally, depending on their purpose, cookies can be classified as follows:</p>
                <h3>Performance Cookies</h3>
                <p>This type of Cookie remembers your preferences for the tools found in the services, so you do not have to reconfigure the service each time you visit. As an example, this typology includes: Volume settings for video or sound players. Video streaming speeds that are compatible with your browser. Items saved in the "shopping cart" in e-commerce services such as stores.</p>
                <h3>Geo-location Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies are used to find out which country you are in when a service is requested. This cookie is completely anonymous and is only used to help target content to your location.</p>
                <h3>Registration Cookies</h3>
                <p>Registration cookies are generated once the user has registered or subsequently opened their session, and are used to identify them in the services with the following objectives:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep the user identified so that, if they close a service, the browser, or the computer, and at another time or another day they enter that service again, they will still be identified, thus facilitating their navigation without having to identify themselves again. This functionality can be suppressed if the user presses the [logout] function, so that this cookie is deleted and the next time the user enters the service they will have to log in to be identified.</li>
                    <li>Check if the user is authorized to access certain services, for example, to participate in a contest.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Additionally, some services may use connectors with social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. When the user registers for a service with credentials from a social network, they authorize the social network to save a persistent cookie that remembers their identity and guarantees access to the services until it expires. The user can delete this Cookie and revoke access to the services through social networks by updating their preferences on the specific social network.</p>
                <h3>Analytics Cookies</h3>
                <p>Each time a user visits a service, a tool from an external provider generates an analytical cookie on the user's computer. This cookie, which is only generated on the visit, will serve in future visits to { jc - developer } or Toggle Word Quest services to anonymously identify the visitor. The main objectives pursued are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allow the anonymous identification of browsing users through the cookie (identifies browsers and devices, not people) and therefore the approximate counting of the number of visitors and their trend over time.</li>
                    <li>Anonymously identify the most visited contents and therefore the most attractive to users. Know if the user accessing is new or a repeat visitor.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Important: Unless the user decides to register for a { jc - developer } or Toggle Word Quest service, the cookie will never be associated with any personal data that can identify them. Such cookies will only be used for statistical purposes to help optimize the user experience on the site.</p>
                <h3>Advertising Cookies</h3>
                <p>This type of cookies allows the expansion of the information of the ads shown to each anonymous user in { jc - developer } or Toggle Word Quest services. Among others, it stores the duration or frequency of display of advertising positions, the interaction with them, or the navigation patterns and/or behaviors of the user as it helps to shape an advertising interest profile. In this way, they allow offering advertising related to the user's interests.</p>
                <h3>Third-Party Advertising Cookies</h3>
                <p>In addition to the advertising managed by the { jc - developer } or Toggle Word Quest websites in their services, the { jc - developer } or Toggle Word Quest websites offer their advertisers the option to serve ads through third parties ("Ad-Servers"). In this way, these third parties can store cookies sent from { jc - developer } or Toggle Word Quest services from the users' browsers, as well as access the data stored in them.</p>
                <p>The companies that generate these cookies have their own privacy policies. Currently, { jc - developer } or Toggle Word Quest websites use the Doubleclick (Google) platform to manage these services. For more information, please visit http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/#toc-doubleclick and http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/.</p>
